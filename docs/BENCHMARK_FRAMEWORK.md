# LightTrack — Universal Benchmark & Evaluation Framework

Design for hardening the benchmark layer into a reusable, opinionated evaluation framework. Goal: give
teams a *solid default methodology* for LLM evaluation (datasets from real traffic, multi-provider
comparison, a rigorous LLM-as-judge with reports + remediation), since most teams have none.

Status: **design** (extends the shipped Phase 3.5 benchmarks). Drives sub-phases 3.6a–3.6e below.

## 0. Concepts (vocabulary)
- **Dataset** — a versioned set of **DatasetItems** `{input, expected?, context?, tags, source_event_id?}`.
  Built by hand, imported, or **sampled from real events** (with anonymization).
- **PromptVariant** — a named system/instruction prompt under test (`v1`, `v2`, …).
- **Target** — a thing that produces an output: `{provider, model, prompt_variant}`. A benchmark compares
  many targets.
- **Run** — one execution of a benchmark over a dataset for one or more targets, producing **CaseResults**.
- **Rubric** — weighted **dimensions**, each with anchored 0–1 levels; the judge's contract.
- **Report** — aggregated scorecard per target/dimension + **recommendations & "healing"** (remediation).

## 1. Datasets from real data, with anonymization  (#1)
Pipeline: `sample → anonymize → review → freeze`.
- **Sampling** from `events`: by project, time window, model, status, tag; strategies = `recent`, `random`,
  `stratified` (balance by model/outcome), `errors-only`. Target N items; dedupe near-identical inputs.
- **Anonymization** (PII scrub) runs on `input`/`output`/`context` before an item is stored in a dataset:
  - **Heuristic pass (always):** regex for emails, phone numbers, credit cards (Luhn), IBANs, IPs, URLs,
    API keys/secrets, national IDs; replace with typed placeholders (`<EMAIL>`, `<PHONE>`…).
  - **LLM pass (optional):** a `claude -p` call that catches names/orgs/locations/free-text PII the regex
    misses, preserving meaning. Costs per item (judge-engine economics, see DECISIONS D9).
  - Each item records `anonymization: {method, placeholders_count}` for auditability. Original text is
    never copied into the dataset; only the scrubbed version.
- **Output:** a frozen, versioned dataset (immutable once `frozen=true`) so runs are comparable over time.

## 2. Multi-provider / multi-prompt comparison  (#2)
A benchmark defines a **matrix** of targets = `{providers × models} × {prompt variants}`. For each
DatasetItem × target, the framework **generates** an output, then **judges** it.

- **Provider abstraction** (`Generator` trait): `anthropic` (via `claude -p` or API), `openai`, `google`.
  Each needs credentials; see *Open decisions*.
- **Generation vs judging are separated.** The judge model should differ in family from the generator to
  avoid **self-preference bias** (§3). Default judge = Claude Haiku via `claude -p`; when judging Claude
  outputs, prefer pairwise + randomized order, or a neutral judge.
- **Output:** a comparison table — for each dimension and overall: score, pass-rate, **p50/p95 latency**,
  **tokens**, **$ cost** — so "best" is a quality/latency/cost trade-off, not just quality.

## 3. Golden-standard LLM-as-judge methodology  (#3)  ← the core
A clear, defensible scoring system. Defaults encode current best practice (see Sources).

**Rubric.** A rubric is weighted **dimensions** (e.g. *correctness 0.5, completeness 0.2, faithfulness 0.2,
concision 0.1*). Each dimension scores on a **narrow anchored scale** normalized to 0–1, with explicit
level descriptions ("1.0 = fully correct & verifiable; 0.5 = minor error; 0 = wrong/unsupported"). Overall
= weighted sum. Pass = overall ≥ threshold AND no gating dimension below its floor.

**Modes** (pick per goal):
- **Pointwise** (analytic, per-item) — monitoring, dashboards, regression tracking. *(shipped)*
- **Reference-guided** — when `expected` exists, anchor the score to the golden answer. *(shipped: eval prompt)*
- **Pairwise** — A/B between two targets, "which better satisfies the rubric"; best for model/prompt
  *selection* and release gates. Aggregated over items with randomized slot order.

**Judge prompt = RCAF:** Role (impartial judge) · Context (rubric + reference) · Action (score each
dimension with reasoning, then overall) · Format (strict JSON schema). We already use `--json-schema`.

**Calibration & reliability:**
- Narrow anchored scales; few-shot anchor examples (low/med/high) per rubric when available.
- **Self-consistency:** sample the judge k times (or k judges), report mean + agreement; low agreement →
  flag the item as ambiguous rather than trusting one score.
- A **golden/calibration set** of human-labeled items measures judge↔human agreement (Cohen's κ /
  correlation); a rubric isn't "trusted" until agreement clears a bar.

**Bias controls (the four):** position → randomize/shuffle A/B and aggregate; verbosity → rubric explicitly
penalizes unnecessary length; self-preference → judge family ≠ generator family (or pairwise+neutral);
authority → strip provider/model identity from what the judge sees.

**Report & "healing":** per-target × per-dimension scorecard; **failure clustering** (group low-scoring
cases by dimension/pattern); **recommendations** — concrete, actionable: e.g. "completeness lowest on
multi-part questions → add a checklist step to prompt v2", "switch judge off same-family to cut
self-preference", "Haiku within 3% of Sonnet at 1/5 cost → prefer Haiku". Regression vs baseline +
quality/cost/latency trade-off called out explicitly.

## 4. Async benchmark queue (non-blocking)  (#4)
Benchmark runs must never block ingestion. A **jobs** table + a worker loop in `lt-runner`:
- `POST /v1/benchmark-runs:enqueue` inserts a `job {type: bench_run, payload, status: queued}` and returns
  immediately. Ingestion (`POST /v1/events`) is unaffected.
- `lt-runner serve` polls `GET /v1/jobs?status=queued&claim=1` (atomic claim → `running`), executes
  (generate?/judge/aggregate), posts results, marks `done`/`failed` with progress + error.
- States: `queued → running → done|failed`; heartbeat + `attempts` for retry; concurrency cap so judge
  calls don't stampede. **Cloud:** swap the jobs table for Pub/Sub; same worker.

## 5. Latency + token cost, DB-backed price table  (#5)
- **Per-call metrics** captured on generation/judge: `latency_ms`, `input/output/cached tokens`, `cost_usd`.
  Aggregated into runs as p50/p95 latency, total tokens, total $.
- **`model_prices` table** (replaces `pricing.json` as source of truth; JSON becomes the seed/bootstrap):
  `provider, model, input_per_mtok, output_per_mtok, cached_input_per_mtok, effective_date, source_url`.
  Seeded from official pages (researched 2026-05-31 — see `config/pricing.json` sources). Cost is computed
  from the row whose `effective_date` ≤ the event time (price history preserved). Tiered (Gemini Pro by
  prompt length) and batch/flex rates are noted as a future extension.
- API: `GET /v1/prices`, `PUT /v1/prices/:provider/:model` (admin) so prices update without redeploys.

## Data model additions (SQLite ↔ BigQuery, behind the Store trait)
```
datasets(id, project_id, name, version, frozen, source, created_at)
dataset_items(id, dataset_id, input, expected?, context?, tags, source_event_id?, anonymization)
prompt_variants(id, project_id, name, label, system_prompt)
targets(id, benchmark_id, provider, model, prompt_variant_id?)   -- the matrix
benchmark_runs(... + target_id?, p50_latency_ms, p95_latency_ms, total_tokens, total_cost_usd, report)
case_results(id, run_id, dataset_item_id, target_id, output, latency_ms, tokens, cost_usd, scores_json)
rubrics(id, project_id, name, dimensions_json, threshold)        -- weighted anchored dimensions
model_prices(provider, model, input_per_mtok, output_per_mtok, cached_input_per_mtok, effective_date, source_url)
jobs(id, type, payload_json, status, attempts, progress, error, claimed_at, created_at)
```

## Phased plan
- **3.6a — Cost foundation:** `model_prices` table (seed from researched prices) + `GET/PUT /v1/prices`;
  capture latency + tokens + cost on judge calls; add p50/p95 latency + tokens + $ to runs. *(no new deps)*
- **3.6b — Datasets + anonymization:** datasets/dataset_items; `lt dataset build --from-events` (regex
  scrub + optional `--llm-scrub`); freeze/version.
- **3.6c — Rubric methodology + report:** `rubrics` (weighted anchored dimensions); per-dimension judging;
  self-consistency (k-sample); golden/calibration agreement; report with recommendations & healing.
- **3.6d — Async queue:** `jobs` table + `lt-runner serve` worker; enqueue endpoint; non-blocking.
- **3.6e — Multi-provider generation:** `Generator` trait + OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic clients; target matrix;
  comparison report (quality × latency × cost). *(needs provider API keys)*

## Decisions (resolved 2026-05-31) & status
1. **Generation mode** = Claude-now via `claude -p`; OpenAI/Gemini behind `engine::generate` and activate
   when keyed (return a clear error until then). ✅ shipped in 3.6e.
2. **Anonymization** = hybrid: regex always + optional `--llm-scrub` pass. ✅ shipped in 3.6b.

**All sub-phases 3.6a–3.6e are implemented, tested, and verified live** (see ROADMAP). The **Gemini and
OpenAI generation adapters are now live too** (reqwest/native-tls, keys from `.env`, gen cost priced from
the DB book) — verified in a 3-way Claude/Gemini/OpenAI comparison. Remaining future work: BigQuery/
Firestore Store backends + Pub/Sub queue (Phase 5/packaging), prompt-length-tiered & batch pricing, and a
human-labeled calibration set for judge↔human agreement.
