//! Billing adapters: verify a provider's signed webhook and normalize it into core
//! [`lighttrack_core::RevenueEvent`]s for profit/margin tracking.
//!
//! The trait stays free of any HTTP framework — the API passes the raw request body and the value of
//! the provider's signature header, so the same adapter is reusable from a webhook handler or a poll
//! loop. Stripe ships today (`stripe`); Polar slots in behind the same [`BillingSource`] trait.
